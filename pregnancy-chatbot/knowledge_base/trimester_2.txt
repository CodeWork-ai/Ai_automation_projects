# [[ Trimester 2: The Golden Period ]]
# DIET: Increase iron and calcium intake (lean red meat, dairy, fortified cereals). Energy levels may increase. Focus on a balanced diet with adequate protein.
# EXERCISE: You can often increase intensity. Continue with walking and swimming. Introduce light strength training (e.g., bodyweight squats, pelvic floor exercises) if cleared by a doctor. Avoid exercises that involve lying flat on your back.
# DAILY ROUTINE: Establish a consistent daily walk. This is a good time to start planning for the baby's arrival.
