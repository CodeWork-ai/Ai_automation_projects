# [[ Trimester 3: Preparation ]]
# DIET: Nutrient-dense, smaller, more frequent meals are best as the baby takes up more space. Focus on Omega-3s (salmon) for baby's brain development.
# EXERCISE: Scale back intensity. Focus on walking, stretching, and birth preparation exercises like pelvic tilts and squats. Comfort is the priority.
# DAILY ROUTINE: Rest and elevate your feet when possible. Pack your hospital bag. Practice breathing exercises for labor.
