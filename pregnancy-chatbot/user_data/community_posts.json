Some moments I feel happy and excited, and the next moment, I just want to cry for no reason. I\u2019m constantly anxious \u2014 wondering if everything is okay, if I\u2019m doing things right, or if I\u2019m ready for this change. The tiredness and hormonal shifts are making it hard to focus, and sometimes I feel a bit disconnected from myself. I know it\u2019s all part of the process, but mentally it\u2019s been tougher than I expected.",
