    "text": "Complete Document for RAG Model Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is an AI framework that enhances large language models by combining retrieval systems with generative capabilities. Here's a comprehensive overview covering all aspects of RAG models: What is RAG? RAG is the process of optimizing the output of a large language model by allowing it to reference an authoritative knowledge base outside of its training data sources before generating a response. Instead of relying solely on training data, RAG introduces an information retrieval component that first pulls relevant information from external sources, then combines this with the user query to create more accurate and contextual responses. Core Architecture RAG systems typically follow a five-stage process: 1.​ User Input: The user submits a query or prompt 2.​ Information Retrieval: The system queries external knowledge bases for relevant data 3.​ Data Return: Relevant information is returned from the knowledge base to the integration layer 4.​ Prompt Augmentation: The RAG system creates an enhanced prompt combining the original query with retrieved context 5.",
