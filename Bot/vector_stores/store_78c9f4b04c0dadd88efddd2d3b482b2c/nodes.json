    "text": "Before each run we prune the repository so that every Git object unreachable from the target commit disappears; this guarantees the agent sees only the code that would legitimately be available at that point in history. Except for Terminal-Bench (Terminus-2), every result was produced with our in-house evaluation harness. The harness is derived from SWE-agent, but we clamp the context windows of the Bash and Edit tools and rewrite the system prompt to match the task semantics. All baseline figures denoted with an asterisk () are excerpted directly from their official report or public leaderboard; the remaining metrics were evaluated by us under conditions identical to those used for K2-Instruct-0905. For SWE-Dev we go one step further: we overwrite the original repository files and delete any test file that exercises the functions the agent is expected to generate, eliminating any indirect hints about the desired implementation. 4. Deployment You can access Kimi K2's API on https://platform.moonshot.ai , we provide OpenAI/Anthropic-compatible API for you. The Anthropic-compatible API maps temperature by real_temperature = request_temperature  0.6 for better compatible with existing applications. Our model checkpoints are stored in the block-fp8 format, you can find it on Huggingface. Currently, Kimi-K2 is recommended to run on the following inference engines: vLLM SGLang KTransformers TensorRT-LLM Deployment examples for vLLM and SGLang can be found in the Model Deployment Guide. 5. Model Usage Chat Completion Once the local inference service is up, you can interact with it through the chat endpoint: def simple_chat(client: OpenAI, model_name: str): messages =  for field status updates and consider signing up for text alerts for the latest information.

Understanding Evolution: The Effects of Mutations Mutations are a fundamental driver of evolutionary change, and understanding their effects is crucial for comprehending the evolutionary process. A single germ line mutation can have a range of effects on an organism's phenotype, which can be categorized into three main types: no change, small change, and big change. No Change in Phenotype Some mutations don't have any noticeable effect on the phenotype of an organism. This can happen in several situations: perhaps the mutation occurs in a stretch of DNA with no function, or perhaps the mutation occurs in a protein-coding region, but ends up not affecting the amino acid sequence of the protein.",

This can happen in several situations: perhaps the mutation occurs in a stretch of DNA with no function, or perhaps the mutation occurs in a protein-coding region, but ends up not affecting the amino acid sequence of the protein. For example, a mutation in a non-coding region of DNA may not have any noticeable effect on the organism's phenotype. Small Change in Phenotype A single mutation can cause a small change in an organism's phenotype. For instance, a cat with a curled-ear mutation has ears that curl backwards slightly due to a single mutation. This type of mutation can have a noticeable effect on the organism's appearance or physiology, but it may not have a significant impact on its overall fitness or survival. Big Change in Phenotype A single mutation can also cause a big change in an organism's phenotype. This type of mutation can have a significant impact on the organism's appearance, physiology, or behavior, and may affect its overall fitness or survival. For example, a mutation that affects the development of an organism's limbs or sensory organs can have a profound impact on its ability to survive and reproduce. The molecular mechanisms underlying each type of effect are complex and involve multiple factors. For example, a mutation in a protein-coding region can affect the structure and function of the resulting protein, which can in turn affect the organism's phenotype. Additionally, environmental factors can influence the effects of a mutation, and may interact with the mutation to produce a particular phenotype. In conclusion, understanding the effects of mutations is essential for comprehending the evolutionary process. By categorizing the effects of a single germ line mutation into three main types – no change, small change, and big change – we can better understand the complex relationships between mutations and phenotypic changes. Further research and exploration of the molecular mechanisms underlying each type of effect can provide valuable insights into the evolutionary process and the diversity of life on Earth.",

They are distinguished by their superior training and equipment compared to their recruit counterparts, marking them as a formidable force within the Legion's infantry. Characteristics of Prime Legionaries Prime Legionaries are easily recognizable due to their distinctive crimson-colored armor and unique visor that extends over their eyes as part of their covered helmets. This attire not only signifies their elite status but also provides them with enhanced protection in combat. They are primarily equipped with hunting rifles, although they can occasionally be found wielding more advanced weaponry such as Marksman carbines, particularly in key locations like Hoover Dam or as part of specialized squads like the Legionary Assassins. Interactions with the Player Character Prime Legionaries play a significant role in the game's world, often encountered in Legion-controlled areas such as The Fort, Cottonwood Cove, and Nelson. They usually travel in squads that may include higher-ranking Legion members, such as Veteran Legionaries or Decani. While they do not offer services like trading or repair, interactions with them can be pivotal in understanding the Legion's dynamics and motivations within the game's narrative. Behind the Scenes: Historical Inspiration The concept of Prime Legionaries draws inspiration from the Roman Republic's military structure, specifically the Principes. The Principes were more experienced and better equipped than the Hastati, forming the second line in the Roman legion's formation. This historical backdrop adds depth to the game's world-building, reflecting the developers' attention to detail in creating immersive and believable factions within the Fallout universe. Conclusion Prime Legionaries are a fascinating aspect of Fallout: New Vegas, offering insights into the game's rich lore and complex faction dynamics.

The concept of being \"governed by imperatives\" is a fascinating one, and it's something that I've been thinking about a lot lately. For me, imperatives are those things that I feel like I must know, do, or have in order to live a fulfilling and meaningful life. They can be big or small, significant or trivial, but they all share one thing in common: they're essential to who I am and what I want to achieve. My imperatives are a diverse and ever-changing list, and they reflect my interests, values, and priorities. Some of them are self-improving, like learning new languages or developing my social skills. Others are more indulgent, like collecting stationery or trying out new beauty routines. And then there are the imperatives that are simply a part of my daily life, like grading papers or writing research proposals. One of the challenges of being governed by imperatives is that it can be overwhelming. There are always so many things that I feel like I need to do or accomplish, and it can be hard to prioritize and manage my time. This is especially true when I have a lot of different imperatives competing for my attention, like during RU's fall break. With a six-day weekend stretching out before me, I have to navigate a long list of tasks and responsibilities, from grading papers to replacing my windshield. Despite the chaos and complexity of my imperatives, I'm grateful to have them.",

They also remind me of what's truly important to me, and what I want to achieve in the short and long term. Of course, being governed by imperatives isn't always easy. There are times when I feel like I'm spreading myself too thin, or when I'm not living up to my own expectations. But overall, I think that my imperatives are a net positive, and they help me to live a more intentional and fulfilling life. As I look back on my imperatives, I realize that they're not just about what I want to achieve or acquire. They're also about the relationships I have with others, and the ways in which I connect and interact with the world around me. My readers, for example, are an important part of my imperatives, and I value the conversations and connections that we have through this blog. In the end, being governed by imperatives is a complex and multifaceted experience, and it's one that I'm still navigating and exploring. But I'm grateful for the challenges and opportunities that it presents, and I'm excited to see where my imperatives will take me in the future.

    "text": "Light winds and clear skies will allow patchy fog to develop late tonight and continue through sunrise. There is a slight chance of isolated showers and thunderstorms in far northwest Buchanan county late Wednesday afternoon, but confidence is low. Long-Term Forecast (Wednesday Night through Tuesday) The main forecast concern for the long term is the chances of rain and thunderstorms Thursday as a low-pressure system slides across the area, dragging a cold front with it. There is uncertainty in the forecast, with differences between the model solutions, but the latest guidance suggests a high chance of precipitation across the area. A shortwave trough and wave at H5 will lead to the development of a low in the models, which will move across the CWA on Thursday. Showers and thunderstorms are possible along this front, with the highest chances in the afternoon and evening. As the low moves out of the area, a back door cold front will slide in from the Great Lakes, leading to cooler temperatures and a quiet weekend. The ECMWF model maintains mostly dry conditions for the area, but the blend suggests low-end chance to slight chance pops associated with the convergence on the lake-induced cold front. Aviation Near calm winds and mainly clear skies, along with a strengthening low-level inversion, will foster at least patchy fog development toward daybreak. Expect MVFR conditions with any fog, with a possibility of IFR/LIFR/VLIFR conditions. Outside of any fog, anticipate VFR conditions. Some shower and storm chances will exist by Wednesday afternoon through evening ahead of a cold front, but confidence is low. DVN Watches/Warnings/Advisories None at this time. Probability Forecast There is a 30% chance of showers and thunderstorms on Thursday, with the highest chances in the afternoon and evening. There is a 20% chance of precipitation on Friday, with mostly dry conditions expected over the weekend. This forecast is subject to change as new model data and forecast guidance become available.

The Great Bedroom Refurbishment Debacle As I stand amidst the chaos of my daughter's bedroom refurbishment, I am reminded of the wise words: \"be careful what you wish for.\" What started as a simple idea to give my daughter's room a fresh new look has rapidly descended into a nightmare of epic proportions. The room, once a tranquil oasis, is now a war zone of debris and destruction. Furniture is disassembled, walls are bare, and the floor is a sea of dust and chaos. And at the center of it all is my daughter, clinging to her beloved possessions like a shipwreck survivor clinging to a liferaft. I must admit, I underestimated the sheer volume of \"treasures\" that my daughter had accumulated over the years. From scribbly sketches to soft toys, every item is precious and irreplaceable in her eyes. And as I gaze upon the mountain of clutter, I am struck by the realization that I may have created a monster – a mini-hoarder in the making. But I digress. The task at hand is to transform this chaotic mess into a beautiful and functional space that my daughter will love. And so, I embark on a journey of paint swatches, furniture assembly, and decorative decisions. It's a daunting task, but someone has to do it. As I navigate the treacherous waters of DIY decorating, I find myself drawing inspiration from our recent trip to Edinburgh. The city's vibrant atmosphere and rich history are a far cry from the chaos of my daughter's bedroom, but they remind me of the importance of creating a space that is both beautiful and functional.",

    "text": "And so, I embark on a journey of paint swatches, furniture assembly, and decorative decisions. It's a daunting task, but someone has to do it. As I navigate the treacherous waters of DIY decorating, I find myself drawing inspiration from our recent trip to Edinburgh. The city's vibrant atmosphere and rich history are a far cry from the chaos of my daughter's bedroom, but they remind me of the importance of creating a space that is both beautiful and functional. Our visit to the National Museum and the Real Mary King's Close were particular highlights, and I find myself drawing parallels between the historic architecture and the modern-day chaos of my daughter's room. And of course, no trip to Edinburgh would be complete without a visit to the iconic Ikea, where my daughter's eyes grew wide with wonder at the endless possibilities of Swedish design. As I reflect on the experience, I realize that the great bedroom refurbishment debacle is not just about decorating a room – it's about creating a space that reflects my daughter's personality and style. It's about navigating the challenges of parenthood and finding a balance between functionality and aesthetics. And it's about surviving the chaos and emerging victorious, with a beautiful new room and a newfound appreciation for the art of DIY decorating. To integrate Spring Webflow 2 with Commons Validator and validate forms based on event IDs, you can follow these steps: 1. Create a custom validator that extends the DefaultBeanValidator and overrides the validate method to take into account the event ID. You can use the `ValidationContext` object to access the event ID and apply exclusions dynamically. ```java public class CustomValidator extends DefaultBeanValidator { @Override public void validate(Object obj, Errors errors) { // Get the event ID from the ValidationContext String eventId = ((ValidationContext) errors).getUserEvent(); // Apply exclusions based on the event ID if (eventId.equals(\"next\")) { // Skip validation for the \"next\" event return; } // Call the default validation method super.validate(obj, errors); } } ``` 2.",

Use the validation.xml file to define the validations and exclusions for each field. You can use the `ValidatorFactory` to configure the custom validator and validation.xml file. ```xml <bean id=\"validatorFactory\" class=\"org.springmodules.validation.commons.DefaultValidatorFactory\"> <property name=\"validationConfigLocations\"> <list> <value>classpath:validation.xml</value> </list> </property> </bean> <bean id=\"customValidator\" class=\"CustomValidator\"> <property name=\"validatorFactory\" ref=\"validatorFactory\"/> </bean> ``` 3. Intercept the validation process to apply exclusions dynamically based on the event ID. You can use the `ValidationInterceptor` to intercept the validation process and apply exclusions. ```java public class ValidationInterceptor implements MethodInterceptor { @Override public Object invoke(MethodInvocation invocation) throws Throwable { // Get the event ID from the MethodInvocation String eventId = (String) invocation.getArguments()[0]; // Apply exclusions based on the event ID if (eventId.equals(\"next\")) { // Skip validation for the \"next\" event return null; } // Call the default validation method return invocation.proceed(); } } ``` 4.

Note that this solution requires a combination of custom validation, validation.xml configuration, and interception of the validation process. You may need to modify the code snippets and configuration files to fit your specific use case. Additionally, you can use the `ValidatorFactory` to configure multiple validators and validation.xml files for different forms. You can also use the `ValidationInterceptor` to intercept the validation process and apply exclusions dynamically based on the event ID. I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need more assistance. The original poster is seeking a feature in Lightwave Layout that allows them to plot a path for a character to follow while performing a walk cycle, similar to the \"footsteps\" feature in 3DMAX. To address this question, I will break down the problem into smaller parts and explore possible solutions. First, let's assume that the character's walk cycle is already animated. In this case, the focus is solely on plotting the path for the character to follow. Lightwave provides a motion path tool that can be used to guide the character's movement. However, if this tool is not sufficient, there are third-party plugins available that provide more advanced path-following capabilities, such as ACS4 or Messiah:Animate 4. To determine the best approach, let's consider the key assumptions underlying this problem. Is the character's walk cycle already animated, or does the solution need to include animating the walk cycle as well?",

To determine the best approach, let's consider the key assumptions underlying this problem. Is the character's walk cycle already animated, or does the solution need to include animating the walk cycle as well? Are there any specific requirements for the path, such as it being a straight line, a curve, or a complex trajectory? If the walk cycle is already animated, then the solution can focus solely on plotting the path. In this case, the motion path tool in Lightwave can be used to create a path for the character to follow. However, if the walk cycle needs to be animated, then that adds an additional layer of complexity to the problem. In Lightwave, the motion path tool can be used to create a path for the character to follow. To do this, the user can create a motion path and then assign it to the character. The character will then follow the motion path, allowing the user to control its movement. Alternatively, third-party plugins like ACS4 or Messiah:Animate 4 can be used to provide more advanced path-following capabilities. These plugins can be used to create complex motion paths and to animate the character's movement along those paths. Another possible approach is to use a scripting language to animate the character's movement along a path. This can be done using Lightwave's built-in scripting language, LScript, or using a third-party scripting language like Python. In conclusion, there are several possible solutions to the problem of plotting a path for a character to follow while performing a walk cycle in Lightwave. The best approach will depend on the specific requirements of the project and the user's level of experience with Lightwave and its plugins. Here is a step-by-step plan to implement the solution: 1. Verify that the character's walk cycle is already animated. 2.",

To achieve an Ajax-enabled file upload feature in .Net 2.0, we can use an iframe-based approach. This involves creating an iframe that contains the FileUpload control and using JavaScript to handle the upload process and update the progress bar. First, we need to create an ASP.NET page that contains the FileUpload control and an iframe. The iframe will be used to upload the file, while the main page will display the progress bar. ```asp <%@ Page Language=\"C\" %> <script runat=\"server\"> protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) { // Initialize the iframe iframe1.Attributes[\"src\"] = \"upload.aspx\"; } </script> <html> <body> <form id=\"form1\" runat=\"server\"> <asp:FileUpload ID=\"FileUpload1\" runat=\"server\" /> <iframe id=\"iframe1\" runat=\"server\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\"></iframe> <img id=\"progressBar\" src=\"progress.gif\" style=\"display: none;\" /> </form> </body> </html> ``` Next, we need to create a separate ASP.NET page (upload.aspx) that will handle the file upload process.",

The generation process involves taking all documents that are of moderate quality (i.e., having passed some rule-based filters), using an LLM (Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct) to identify the purpose of the text content, and then asking the LLM to come up with an improved document conditioned on chain-of-thought reasoning. Our approach specifically targets the vast quantity of low-quality documents that are somewhat informative but still not considered high-quality by existing filters.

Dataset Sources Paper: Recycling the Web: A Method to Enhance Pre-training Data Quality and Quantity for Language Models, COLM 2025 Uses Direct Use The data is intended for pre-training large language models (LLMs), and designed with the goal of complementing existing web-scraped texts. Dataset Creation Curation Rationale The data was obtained by using an LLM to rewrite low-quality documents that have been discarded by quality filters, in order to make them useful for pre-training. This helps increase the token availability and address the impending data bottleneck, as the growth of public human-generated texts has been lagging behind the increase in model capacity and training token budget. Across different model scales, we find that mixing our synthetic data and high-quality web data consistently outperforms training on only the latter. Source Data Data Collection and Processing We first gathered raw web documents from DCLM-RefinedWeb (Li et al., 2024), Common Crawl data that has passed the rule-based quality filters from RefinedWeb (Penedo et al., 2023) (e.g., repetition filter, page length filter, URL filter, etc.) and global deduplication, but has not gone through model-based filtering. We then prompted Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct (Grattafiori et al., 2024) to perform chain-of-thought reasoning on the original web documents, such as identifying the task or purpose of the text, reasoning about the steps needed to achieve the purpose, etc. before generating an improved version of the documents. Refer to our paper for the full prompt we used. We applied this rewriting process to all documents in the starting pool (DCLM-RefinedWeb).",

(CVPR 2025) Highlights We introduce FastViTHD, a novel hybrid vision encoder designed to output fewer tokens and significantly reduce encoding time for high-resolution images. Our smallest variant outperforms LLaVA-OneVision-0.5B with 85x faster Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) and 3.4x smaller vision encoder. Our larger variants using Qwen2-7B LLM outperform recent works like Cambrian-1-8B while using a single image encoder with a 7.9x faster TTFT.",

PEFT methods only fine-tune a small number of (extra) model parameters - significantly decreasing computational and storage costs - while yielding performance comparable to a fully fine-tuned model. This makes it more accessible to train and store large language models (LLMs) on consumer hardware. PEFT is integrated with the Transformers, Diffusers, and Accelerate libraries to provide a faster and easier way to load, train, and use large models for inference.",

The reticulum traps foreign objects and also helps in fermentation. The omasum absorbs water and nutrients, and the abomasum is the true stomach where digestion occurs similarly to monogastric animals.\\n- Microbial Fermentation: The microbes in the rumen produce volatile fatty acids which are the primary energy source for ruminants. They also produce gases like methane, which are eructated (belched) out.\\n- Ruminant Nutrition: Ruminants rely on a high-fiber diet and have to consume large quantities of forage to meet their nutritional needs.\"}], 'source': 'original', 'image_correspondence_ratings': [4, 3], 'image_correspondence_min': 3, 'visual_dependency_ratings': [4, 5], 'visual_dependency_min': 4, 'formatting_ratings': [4, 4], 'formatting_min': 4, 'relevance_ratings': [5, 5], 'relevance_min': 5 } Categories Licensing Information Each of the publicly available sub-datasets present in FineVision are governed by specific licensing conditions.

A core innovation of VibeVoice is its use of continuous speech tokenizers (Acoustic and Semantic) operating at an ultra-low frame rate of 7.5 Hz. These tokenizers efficiently preserve audio fidelity while significantly boosting computational efficiency for processing long sequences. VibeVoice employs a next-token diffusion framework, leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM) to understand textual context and dialogue flow, and a diffusion head to generate high-fidelity acoustic details. The model can synthesize speech up to 90 minutes long with up to 4 distinct speakers, surpassing the typical 1-2 speaker limits of many prior models. ➡️ Technical Report: VibeVoice Technical Report ➡️ Project Page: microsoft/VibeVoice ➡️ Code: microsoft/VibeVoice-Code Training Details Transformer-based Large Language Model (LLM) integrated with specialized acoustic and semantic tokenizers and a diffusion-based decoding head. LLM: Qwen2.5-1.5B for this release. Tokenizers: Acoustic Tokenizer: Based on a σ-VAE variant (proposed in LatentLM), with a mirror-symmetric encoder-decoder structure featuring 7 stages of modified Transformer blocks. Achieves 3200x downsampling from 24kHz input. Encoder/decoder components are ~340M parameters each. Semantic Tokenizer: Encoder mirrors the Acoustic Tokenizer's architecture (without VAE components). Trained with an ASR proxy task. Diffusion Head: Lightweight module (4 layers, ~123M parameters) conditioned on LLM hidden states. Predicts acoustic VAE features using a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) process. Uses Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) and DPM-Solver (and variants) during inference. Context Length: Trained with a curriculum increasing up to 65,536 tokens.",

Real‑time or low‑latency voice conversion – telephone or video‑conference “live deep‑fake” applications. Unsupported language – the model is trained only on English and Chinese data; outputs in other languages are unsupported and may be unintelligible or offensive. Generation of background ambience, Foley, or music – VibeVoice is speech‑only and will not produce coherent non‑speech audio. Risks and limitations While efforts have been made to optimize it through various techniques, it may still produce outputs that are unexpected, biased, or inaccurate. VibeVoice inherits any biases, errors, or omissions produced by its base model (specifically, Qwen2.5 1.5b in this release). Potential for Deepfakes and Disinformation: High-quality synthetic speech can be misused to create convincing fake audio content for impersonation, fraud, or spreading disinformation. Users must ensure transcripts are reliable, check content accuracy, and avoid using generated content in misleading ways. Users are expected to use the generated content and to deploy the models in a lawful manner, in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations in the relevant jurisdictions. It is best practice to disclose the use of AI when sharing AI-generated content. English and Chinese only: Transcripts in language other than English or Chinese may result in unexpected audio outputs. Non-Speech Audio: The model focuses solely on speech synthesis and does not handle background noise, music, or other sound effects. Overlapping Speech: The current model does not explicitly model or generate overlapping speech segments in conversations.

    "text": "We’re releasing two flavors of these open models: gpt-oss-120b — for production, general purpose, high reasoning use cases that fit into a single 80GB GPU (like NVIDIA H100 or AMD MI300X) (117B parameters with 5.1B active parameters) gpt-oss-20b — for lower latency, and local or specialized use cases (21B parameters with 3.6B active parameters) Both models were trained on our harmony response format and should only be used with the harmony format as it will not work correctly otherwise. This model card is dedicated to the larger gpt-oss-120b model. Check out gpt-oss-20b for the smaller model. Highlights Permissive Apache 2.0 license: Build freely without copyleft restrictions or patent risk—ideal for experimentation, customization, and commercial deployment. Configurable reasoning effort: Easily adjust the reasoning effort (low, medium, high) based on your specific use case and latency needs. Full chain-of-thought: Gain complete access to the model’s reasoning process, facilitating easier debugging and increased trust in outputs. It’s not intended to be shown to end users. Fine-tunable: Fully customize models to your specific use case through parameter fine-tuning. Agentic capabilities: Use the models’ native capabilities for function calling, web browsing, Python code execution, and Structured Outputs. MXFP4 quantization: The models were post-trained with MXFP4 quantization of the MoE weights, making gpt-oss-120b run on a single 80GB GPU (like NVIDIA H100 or AMD MI300X) and the gpt-oss-20b model run within 16GB of memory. All evals were performed with the same MXFP4 quantization. Inference examples Transformers You can use gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b with Transformers. If you use the Transformers chat template, it will automatically apply the harmony response format.",

As text length increases, MiniCPM4's efficiency advantage becomes more pronounced. On the Jetson AGX Orin platform, compared to Qwen3-8B, MiniCPM4 achieves approximately 7x decoding speed improvement. MiniCPM4.1 achieves 3x decoding speed improvement in reasoning. Comprehensive Evaluation MiniCPM4.1 launches end-side versions with 8B parameter scale, both achieving best-in-class performance in their respective categories. Long Text Evaluation MiniCPM4 is pre-trained on 32K long texts and achieves length extension through YaRN technology. In the 128K long text needle-in-a-haystack task, MiniCPM4 demonstrates outstanding performance. Statement As a language model, MiniCPM generates content by learning from a vast amount of text.

Transformers.js is designed to be functionally equivalent to Hugging Face’s transformers python library, meaning you can run the same pretrained models using a very similar API. These models support common tasks in different modalities, such as: 📝 Natural Language Processing: text classification, named entity recognition, question answering, language modeling, summarization, translation, multiple choice, and text generation. 🖼️ Computer Vision: image classification, object detection, segmentation, and depth estimation. 🗣️ Audio: automatic speech recognition, audio classification, and text-to-speech. 🐙 Multimodal: embeddings, zero-shot audio classification, zero-shot image classification, and zero-shot object detection. Transformers.js uses ONNX Runtime to run models in the browser. The best part about it, is that you can easily convert your pretrained PyTorch, TensorFlow, or JAX models to ONNX using 🤗 Optimum. For more information, check out the full documentation. Quick tour It’s super simple to translate from existing code! Just like the python library, we support the pipeline API. Pipelines group together a pretrained model with preprocessing of inputs and postprocessing of outputs, making it the easiest way to run models with the library. Python (original) Javascript (ours) Copied from transformers import pipeline Allocate a pipeline for sentiment-analysis pipe = pipeline('sentiment-analysis') out = pipe('I love transformers!')",

For example: Copied // Use a different model for sentiment-analysis const pipe = await pipeline('sentiment-analysis', 'Xenova/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment'); By default, when running in the browser, the model will be run on your CPU (via WASM). If you would like to run the model on your GPU (via WebGPU), you can do this by setting device: 'webgpu', for example: Copied // Run the model on WebGPU const pipe = await pipeline('sentiment-analysis', 'Xenova/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english', { device: 'webgpu', }); For more information, check out the WebGPU guide. The WebGPU API is still experimental in many browsers, so if you run into any issues, please file a bug report. In resource-constrained environments, such as web browsers, it is advisable to use a quantized version of the model to lower bandwidth and optimize performance. This can be achieved by adjusting the dtype option, which allows you to select the appropriate data type for your model.",

EmbeddingGemma model card Model Information Description Inputs and outputs Usage Model Data Training Dataset Data Preprocessing Model Development Hardware Software Evaluation Benchmark Results Prompt Instructions Usage and Limitations Intended Usage Limitations Ethical Considerations and Risks Benefits EmbeddingGemma model card Model Page: EmbeddingGemma Resources and Technical Documentation: Responsible Generative AI Toolkit EmbeddingGemma on Kaggle EmbeddingGemma on Vertex Model Garden Terms of Use: Terms Authors: Google DeepMind Model Information Description EmbeddingGemma is a 300M parameter, state-of-the-art for its size, open embedding model from Google, built from Gemma 3 (with T5Gemma initialization) and the same research and technology used to create Gemini models. EmbeddingGemma produces vector representations of text, making it well-suited for search and retrieval tasks, including classification, clustering, and semantic similarity search. This model was trained with data in 100+ spoken languages. The small size and on-device focus makes it possible to deploy in environments with limited resources such as mobile phones, laptops, or desktops, democratizing access to state of the art AI models and helping foster innovation for everyone. Inputs and outputs Input: Text string, such as a question, a prompt, or a document to be embedded Maximum input context length of 2048 tokens Output: Numerical vector representations of input text data Output embedding dimension size of 768, with smaller options available (512, 256, or 128) via Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL). MRL allows users to truncate the output embedding of size 768 to their desired size and then re-normalize for efficient and accurate representation.",

Code and Technical Documents: Exposing the model to code and technical documentation helps it learn the structure and patterns of programming languages and specialized scientific content, which improves its understanding of code and technical questions. Synthetic and Task-Specific Data: Synthetically training data helps to teach the model specific skills. This includes curated data for tasks like information retrieval, classification, and sentiment analysis, which helps to fine-tune its performance for common embedding applications. The combination of these diverse data sources is crucial for training a powerful multilingual embedding model that can handle a wide variety of different tasks and data formats. Data Preprocessing Here are the key data cleaning and filtering methods applied to the training data: CSAM Filtering: Rigorous CSAM (Child Sexual Abuse Material) filtering was applied at multiple stages in the data preparation process to ensure the exclusion of harmful and illegal content. Sensitive Data Filtering: As part of making Gemma pre-trained models safe and reliable, automated techniques were used to filter out certain personal information and other sensitive data from training sets. Additional methods: Filtering based on content quality and safety in line with our policies. Model Development Hardware EmbeddingGemma was trained using the latest generation of Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) hardware (TPUv5e), for more details refer to the Gemma 3 model card. Software Training was done using JAX and ML Pathways. For more details refer to the Gemma 3 model card.

Prompt Instructions EmbeddingGemma can generate optimized embeddings for various use cases—such as document retrieval, question answering, and fact verification—or for specific input types—either a query or a document—using prompts that are prepended to the input strings. Query prompts follow the form task: {task description} | query: where the task description varies by the use case, with the default task description being search result. Document-style prompts follow the form title: {title | \"none\"} | text: where the title is either none (the default) or the actual title of the document. Note that providing a title, if available, will improve model performance for document prompts but may require manual formatting. Use the following prompts based on your use case and input data type. These may already be available in the EmbeddingGemma configuration in your modeling framework of choice.",

The purpose of this list is to provide contextual information about the possible use-cases that the model creators considered as part of model training and development. Semantic Similarity: Embeddings optimized to assess text similarity, such as recommendation systems and duplicate detection Classification: Embeddings optimized to classify texts according to preset labels, such as sentiment analysis and spam detection Clustering: Embeddings optimized to cluster texts based on their similarities, such as document organization, market research, and anomaly detection Retrieval Document: Embeddings optimized for document search, such as indexing articles, books, or web pages for search Query: Embeddings optimized for general search queries, such as custom search Code Query: Embeddings optimized for retrieval of code blocks based on natural language queries, such as code suggestions and search Question Answering: Embeddings for questions in a question-answering system, optimized for finding documents that answer the question, such as chatbox. Fact Verification: Embeddings for statements that need to be verified, optimized for retrieving documents that contain evidence supporting or refuting the statement, such as automated fact-checking systems. Limitations Training Data The quality and diversity of the training data significantly influence the model's capabilities. Biases or gaps in the training data can lead to limitations in the model's responses. The scope of the training dataset determines the subject areas the model can handle effectively. Language Ambiguity and Nuance Natural language is inherently complex. Models might struggle to grasp subtle nuances, sarcasm, or figurative language.

    "text": "Built upon our 20B Qwen-Image model, Qwen-Image-Edit successfully extends Qwen-Image’s unique text rendering capabilities to image editing tasks, enabling precise text editing. Furthermore, Qwen-Image-Edit simultaneously feeds the input image into Qwen2.5-VL (for visual semantic control) and the VAE Encoder (for visual appearance control), achieving capabilities in both semantic and appearance editing. To experience the latest model, visit Qwen Chat and select the \"Image Editing\" feature. Key Features: Semantic and Appearance Editing: Qwen-Image-Edit supports both low-level visual appearance editing (such as adding, removing, or modifying elements, requiring all other regions of the image to remain completely unchanged) and high-level visual semantic editing (such as IP creation, object rotation, and style transfer, allowing overall pixel changes while maintaining semantic consistency). Precise Text Editing: Qwen-Image-Edit supports bilingual (Chinese and English) text editing, allowing direct addition, deletion, and modification of text in images while preserving the original font, size, and style. Strong Benchmark Performance: Evaluations on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate that Qwen-Image-Edit achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in image editing tasks, establishing it as a powerful foundation model for image editing. Quick Start Install the latest version of diffusers pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers The following contains a code snippet illustrating how to use the model to generate images based on text prompts: import os from PIL import Image import torch from diffusers import QwenImageEditPipeline pipeline = QwenImageEditPipeline.from_pretrained(\"Qwen/Qwen-Image-Edit\") print(\"pipeline loaded\") pipeline.to(torch.bfloat16) pipeline.to(\"cuda\") pipeline.set_progress_bar_config(disable=None) image = Image.open(\"./input.png\").convert(\"RGB\") prompt = \"Change the rabbit's color to purple, with a flash light background.\"",

    "text": "inputs = { \"image\": image, \"prompt\": prompt, \"generator\": torch.manual_seed(0), \"true_cfg_scale\": 4.0, \"negative_prompt\": \" \", \"num_inference_steps\": 50, } with torch.inference_mode(): output = pipeline(inputs) output_image = output.images[0] output_image.save(\"output_image_edit.png\") print(\"image saved at\", os.path.abspath(\"output_image_edit.png\")) Showcase One of the highlights of Qwen-Image-Edit lies in its powerful capabilities for semantic and appearance editing. Semantic editing refers to modifying image content while preserving the original visual semantics. To intuitively demonstrate this capability, let's take Qwen's mascot—Capybara—as an example: As can be seen, although most pixels in the edited image differ from those in the input image (the leftmost image), the character consistency of Capybara is perfectly preserved. Qwen-Image-Edit's powerful semantic editing capability enables effortless and diverse creation of original IP content. Furthermore, on Qwen Chat, we designed a series of editing prompts centered around the 16 MBTI personality types. Leveraging these prompts, we successfully created a set of MBTI-themed emoji packs based on our mascot Capybara, effortlessly expanding the IP's reach and expression. Moreover, novel view synthesis is another key application scenario in semantic editing. As shown in the two example images below, Qwen-Image-Edit can not only rotate objects by 90 degrees, but also perform a full 180-degree rotation, allowing us to directly see the back side of the object: Another typical application of semantic editing is style transfer. For instance, given an input portrait, Qwen-Image-Edit can easily transform it into various artistic styles such as Studio Ghibli. This capability holds significant value in applications like virtual avatar creation: In addition to semantic editing, appearance editing is another common image editing requirement. Appearance editing emphasizes keeping certain regions of the image completely unchanged while adding, removing, or modifying specific elements.",

This capability holds significant value in applications like virtual avatar creation: In addition to semantic editing, appearance editing is another common image editing requirement. Appearance editing emphasizes keeping certain regions of the image completely unchanged while adding, removing, or modifying specific elements. The image below illustrates a case where a signboard is added to the scene. As shown, Qwen-Image-Edit not only successfully inserts the signboard but also generates a corresponding reflection, demonstrating exceptional attention to detail. Below is another interesting example, demonstrating how to remove fine hair strands and other small objects from an image. Additionally, the color of a specific letter \"n\" in the image can be modified to blue, enabling precise editing of particular elements. Appearance editing also has wide-ranging applications in scenarios such as adjusting a person's background or changing clothing. The three images below demonstrate these practical use cases respectively. Another standout feature of Qwen-Image-Edit is its accurate text editing capability, which stems from Qwen-Image's deep expertise in text rendering. As shown below, the following two cases vividly demonstrate Qwen-Image-Edit's powerful performance in editing English text: Qwen-Image-Edit can also directly edit Chinese posters, enabling not only modifications to large headline text but also precise adjustments to even small and intricate text elements. Finally, let's walk through a concrete image editing example to demonstrate how to use a chained editing approach to progressively correct errors in a calligraphy artwork generated by Qwen-Image: In this artwork, several Chinese characters contain generation errors. We can leverage Qwen-Image-Edit to correct them step by step. For instance, we can draw bounding boxes on the original image to mark the regions that need correction, instructing Qwen-Image-Edit to fix these specific areas. Here, we want the character \"稽\" to be correctly written within the red box, and the character \"亭\" to be accurately rendered in the blue region.",

Here, we want the character \"稽\" to be correctly written within the red box, and the character \"亭\" to be accurately rendered in the blue region. However, in practice, the character \"稽\" is relatively obscure, and the model fails to correct it correctly in one step. The lower-right component of \"稽\" should be \"旨\" rather than \"日\". At this point, we can further highlight the \"日\" portion with a red box, instructing Qwen-Image-Edit to fine-tune this detail and replace it with \"旨\". Isn't it amazing? With this chained, step-by-step editing approach, we can continuously correct character errors until the desired final result is achieved. Finally, we have successfully obtained a completely correct calligraphy version of Lantingji Xu (Orchid Pavilion Preface)!
